## App Usage

#### Make sure you've downloaded the code. To do this:
1. Download Repo
2. Run a simple local server
  * On a Mac, you can do this by running the following:

  Python3:
  ```
  python3 -m http.server
  ```
  Python 2:
  ```
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer
  ```
  * If you're on windows, try doing this by installing [Mongoose](https://code.google.com/archive/p/mongoose/)

3. In your browser, go to
```
http://localhost:8000/app/01-static-invitation/
```

Note: You won't be able to sign-in on m.uber.com on your desktop -- to fully test the deep-linking (and call an Uber in the process) you'll need to fire up your iOS Simulator or upload your project to the web and access it from a mobile device
